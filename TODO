# TODO

- Have Setting keep track of its path
    - If it was created at global scope, should contain: 'std::string _path = GLOBAL.table_name'
    - For nested Setting: 'std::string _path = GLOBAL.table_name.nested_name'

- TypeMismatchException should report full path of Setting/Config it was thrown from

- Create object 'Function'
    - Similarly to Setting, will control a lua_State on a new thread
    - At top of its stack, will keep Lua function

- Better unit testing
