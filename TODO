# TODO

- Have Setting keep track of its path
    - If it was created at global scope, should contain: 'std::string _path = GLOBAL.table_name'
    - For nested Setting: 'std::string _path = GLOBAL.table_name.nested_name'

- TypeMismatchException should report full path of Setting/Config it was thrown from

- Better unit testing

- Multiple return types for Function
